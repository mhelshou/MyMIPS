-     always @(Op2 or SA)
    begin
        if (op_shiftr == 1)
            shiftr_result <= Op2 >> SA;
        else
            shiftr_result <= 0;
    end
    
Done. Actually caused a problem with shifts -- A test like the previous one seems to change only when Op2 or SA changes but not when op_shifter changes. Could that lead to an error when two consecutive instructions have the same Op2 / SA (or Op1/Op2 for other instructions) but only the operator changes?

- Write After Read Hazards (since this is a register Hazard, I think it's already handled)
- Read After Write Hazards (since both happen in the Mem Stage, I think we're covered)
- Based on the simplistic Write strobe control using only one clock, you can't have two stores in a row
- Control of writeback could be handled better. Perhaps having that flag being set with every instruction, rather than putting so many comparators
- Develop a better rule for ports and signal naming and rewrite in a less confusing manner
- You can support branch delay slots if you let BranchTaken from Ex go only to the fectch not decode.
